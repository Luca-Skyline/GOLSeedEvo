# GOLSeedEvo
An OOP program that uses a custom evolutionary algorithm in hopes of discovering new fascinating seeds for [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

First, a few notes about this project:
- It is not intended to serve any practical purpose whatsoever. It exists only for the sake of knowledge and beauty.
- Due to the nature of Conway's Game of Life, there is a high liklihood it reveals nothing even when it's fully complete. 
- As far as I'm aware, this hasn't been done before. If it has, my approach will be unique.
